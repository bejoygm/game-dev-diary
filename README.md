Watched [How I learned Unity without following tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFjXKOXdgGo) . A coincidence (or maybe not!) that I have the exact same thoughts. The gist being, stop getting stuck at tutorial hell, just learn the basic amount of start to begin with and start tinkering on your own.

Also, more [Game Programming Patterns](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/) as usual.

Created a repo to note down my learnings of [Game Programming Patterns](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/) in python. Some random ideas I have

- build a game incorporating all the patterns for educational purpose.
- A blog exploring functional patterns inspired from the OO patterns

The Journey beings.

This is the day I have written some basic pong game in pygame by following tutorials. I have dabbled in Godot before this, but it was mostly following tutorials and pressing button. But this is the first time that I actually wrote code on my own to create a game.

After creating pong, I am feeling bit stumped though. I don't know what exactly I want to do next.

So I started reading a book called [Game Programming Patterns](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/)

I'm coding in the patterns in python to get a deeper understanding of the patterns.
