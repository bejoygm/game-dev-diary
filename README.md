A daily dev log for my journey into the game development world. I'm going to try this at least for a year.  

### Motivation

- Get good at game dev, try out different techniques every day
- To find out some general learning patterns. Everybody learns differently, but I want to find out whether a learning ladder (or roadmap) can accelerate knowledge acquisition.

### 19 Oct 2021

- Finally figured out the enemy collision logic in [Make Your First 2D Game with Godot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc13Z2gboEk)

### 18 Oct 2021

- ðŸŒŠ Floods! No power, no work done

---

### 17 Oct 2021

- Tried some recipes from  [Godot Recipes](https://kidscancode.org/godot_recipes/). Excellent resources after learning some basics.

### 16 Oct 2021

- Animations for solarpunk game.

---

### 15 Oct 2021

- Started working on solarpunk themed game. Some player movement code.

---

### 14 Oct 2021

- Completed [Miziziziz Godot Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU-4dfo0-RA), best tutorial to get started for beginners so far.

---

### 13 Oct 2021

- Continuing with [Miziziziz Godot Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU-4dfo0-RA)
- Learned about [RayCast2D](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_raycast2d.html)

### 12 Oct 2021

- Couldn't figure out enemy collision logic in [Make Your First 2D Game with Godot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc13Z2gboEk), wasted around 3+ hours
-  Moved onto [Miziziziz Godot Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU-4dfo0-RA)
- [Creating particle effects in pygame](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfcsB3SGsKY). Interesting

### 11 Oct 2021

- Added music/sounds in [brick breaker](https://github.com/bejoygm/game-experiments)
- Movement logic, player and enemy creation from [Make Your First 2D Game with Godot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc13Z2gboEk) 
- [VisibilityEnabler2D](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_visibilityenabler2d.html#visibilityenabler2d) is some cool stuff
- There's a ctrl+shift+enter shortcut?! After 5 years of programming here I am

### 10 Oct 2021

- More [Game Programming Patterns](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/) . Prototype and Singleton pattern
- Started on [Make Your First 2D Game with Godot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc13Z2gboEk) 

---

### 9 Oct 2021

- Add perks spawn in [brick breaker](https://github.com/bejoygm/game-experiments)
- Explored some ideas around solarpunk in preparation of Godot game jam.

---

### 8 Oct 2021

Coded a basic [brick breaker](https://github.com/bejoygm/game-experiments) game using pygame. Adding some collectable perks (like bullets, multiply balls etc)

Reading [Game Programming Patterns](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/) was a good idea. I can already identify some areas where I could apply those patterns

### 7 Oct 2021

Watched [How I learned Unity without following tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFjXKOXdgGo) . A coincidence (or maybe not!) that I have the exact same thoughts. The gist being, stop getting stuck at tutorial hell, just learn the basic amount to begin with and start tinkering on your own.

Also, more [Game Programming Patterns](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/) as usual.

---

### 6 Oct 2021

Created a repo to note down my learnings of [Game Programming Patterns](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/) in python. Some random ideas I have

- build a game incorporating all the patterns for educational purpose.
- A blog exploring functional patterns inspired from the OO patterns

### 5 Oct 2021

Continuing with game programming patterns.

### 4 Oct 2021

The Journey beings.

This is the day I have written some basic pong game in pygame by following tutorials. I have dabbled in Godot before this, but it was mostly following tutorials and pressing button. But this is the first time that I actually wrote code on my own to create a game.

After creating pong, I am feeling bit stumped though. I don't know what exactly I want to do next.

So I started reading a book called [Game Programming Patterns](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/)

I'm coding in the patterns in python to get a deeper understanding of the patterns.
